Project Title : Emergency Care for Accidental Person (Smart India Hackathon 2020)

We aim to design a system that helps in providing healthcare to accidental person in a proper way and in time by tracking all participants which actively contribute to the traditional healthcare system and also time-stamp of each case. This system connects all the hospitals, police stations, and ambulance drivers. The ambulance driver can see the nearest hospitals according to his location and also he can send the request to the nearest hospital. As well as hospitals and police stations get notified. Police station and ambulance driver will able to see statistics of cases handled according to accident type (e.g. road accident, burn injuries, etc.) and case report is generated at the police station side. These records will get maintained digitally.
